We estimate the impact of ten different scenarios of sea level rise, from 1 m to 10 m increases in mean sea level. The results of the analysis reveal the size of the area flooded, count of parcels, and millions of flooded property losses.\nWe present our results in a map and table.\nMethods\nWe used geospatial data representing the inundation scenarios, net assessed value (USD) for parcels, and a basemap of California. We merged the inundation scenarios into a single layer, then joined the layer with the parcels data. To find the flooded area, we used the $area function in the QGIS field calculator. Additionally, we converted the net assessed values to units of millions of USD.\nOur initial results are presented in the table below.\n\n\nInundation scenario\n\n\nNumber of Parcels\n\n\nArea (sq m)\n\n\nNet Value (millions of USD)\n\n\n1\n\n\n60\n\n\n11\n\n\n51\n\n\n2\n\n\n89\n\n\n31\n\n\n88\n\n\n3\n\n\n227\n\n\n89\n\n\n195\n\n\n4\n\n\n620\n\n\n221\n\n\n566\n\n\n5\n\n\n1275\n\n\n316\n\n\n909\n\n\n6\n\n\n1863\n\n\n372\n\n\n1215\n\n\n7\n\n\n2196\n\n\n422\n\n\n1372\n\n\n8\n\n\n2614\n\n\n467\n\n\n1555\n\n\n9\n\n\n2958\n\n\n504\n\n\n1712\n\n\n10\n\n\n3287\n\n\n543\n\n\n1881\n\n\nResults and analysis\nWe presented our results in the map below.\n\nThe map indicates the different inundation scenarios in Santa Barbara County, with dark blue indicating the worst scenario of 9.5 m to 10 m of sea level rise.

Additionally, we perform sentiment analysis using the nrc lexicon to visualize the sentiments used throughout the film.\n\n\nendgame_text <- pdf_text(\"endgame.pdf\")\n\n\n\nText wrangling\nTo begin, we create a tidy dataframe based off of a PDF of the screenplay. We wrangle the dataset to remove all stop words, so that our end result is all non-stop words used in the screenplay. These are the words that we use in our next steps to look at both the most used words and most used sentiments in the film.\n\n\n# Creating a tidy dataframe\nendgame_tidy <- data.frame(endgame_text) %>% \n  mutate(text_full = str_split(endgame_text, pattern = \"\\\\n\")) %>% \n  unnest(text_full) %>% \n  mutate(text_full = str_trim(text_full)) %>% \n  slice(-(1:8))\n\nendgame_tokens <- endgame_tidy %>% \n  unnest_tokens(word, text_full) %>% \n  select(-endgame_text)\n\n# Remove all stopwords, then look at what the counts look like\nendgame_nonstop <- endgame_tokens %>% \n  anti_join(stop_words)\n\nnonstop_counts <- endgame_nonstop %>% \n  count(word)\n\n\n\nWord cloud of top most used words in Avengers: Endgame\nBefore creating our word cloud, we wrangle the data further to look at the top most used words, arranged in ascending order, then look at only the top 100 words.\n\n\n# Looking at the top most used words in the screenplay\ntop_5 <- nonstop_counts %>% \n  arrange(-n) %>% \n  slice(1:5)\n\n# Because our word cloud will have the top 100 most used words, first create a subset of the top 100 words\ntop_100 <- nonstop_counts %>% \n  arrange(-n) %>% \n  slice(1:100)\n\n\n\nNext, we are able to use ggplot to create a wordcloud of the wrangled text. We use color and size to indicate the larger presence of the words.\n\n\n# Creating a word cloud of the top words used \n\nggplot(data = top_100, aes(label = word)) +\n  geom_text_wordcloud(aes(color = n, size = n), shape = \"diamond\") +\n  scale_size_area(max_size = 6) +\n  scale_colour_gradientn(colors = c(\"cyan3\",\"blue\",\"purple\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Top 100 words in Avengers: Endgame\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. A wordcloud to visualize the top 100 words used in the screenplay for Avengers: Endgame. Bigger words indicate a more frequently used word. Purple, blue, and cyan colors indicate a word appears more to less frequently, respectively.\nUsing sentiment analysis to visualize the sentiments of Avengers: Endgame\nNext, we use sentiment analysis to visualize the number of occurrences of different sentiments in the screenplay. To do so, we first look at both the afinn and nrc lexicons. We proceed to use the nrc lexicon to create a plot visualizing the top used sentiments, based on counts, in Avengers: Endgame.\n\n\n# First looking at what the words look like in \"afinn\"\nafinn_pos <-get_sentiments(\"afinn\") %>% \n  filter(value > 2)\n\n# Looking at \"afinn\" specifically four our text, then getting the counts\nendgame_afinn <- endgame_nonstop %>% \n  inner_join(get_sentiments(\"afinn\"))\n\nafinn_counts <- endgame_afinn %>% \n  count(value)\n\n# Performing the same steps, but for \"nrc\", which we will then use for our plot.\n\nendgame_nrc <- endgame_nonstop %>% \n  inner_join(get_sentiments(\"nrc\"))\n\nnrc_counts <- endgame_nrc %>% \n  count(sentiment)\n\nggplot(data = nrc_counts, aes(x = reorder (sentiment, -n), y = n)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(title = \"Sentiment analysis for Avengers: Endgame\",\n       x = \"Sentiment\", y = \"Number of occurences\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

    "contents": "\nAn overview\nPublic campaigns are an essential tool to communicate and frame proposals to key audiences. In this report, we design a public campaign opposing the Green New Deal, aimed towards New York’s 22nd Congressional District, with the purpose of unseating incumbent Representative Anthony Brindisi. To do so, we look at a number of key variables of congressional districts related to global warming as well as the votes from previous elections. Then, we create a graph to look at the relationship between two of the global warming variables and identify in which the relationship is strongest, in order to select which elected audience may be easily swayed and thus which congressperson could potentially be unseated.\n\n\n# Reading in the data for the 116th Congress\ndata <- read.csv(here(\"data\",\"congress_116_data.csv\"))\nmetadata <- read.csv(here(\"data\",\"Combined_Metadata.csv\"))\n\n# Reordering metadata 'variable' to match variable order in 'data':\norder <- match(names(data),metadata$variable)\nmetadata <- metadata[order,]\n\n\n\nSelecting a congressional district\nTo begin, we filter a dataset from the 116th Congress to select for Democrats who won their election in 2018 by less than 51% and have a high LCV score. From these congresspeople, we select for a few different variables related to global warming to look at the percentage of constituents who believe:\nGlobal warming is occuring\nGlobal warming is caused by natural influence, not by human influence\nCongress should not act or should act less on global warming\nWe create a table to get an overview of what these congressional districts look like.\n\n\n# Filtering for democrats who barely won their seat in the general, have a high lcv score and have high opposition of key GW variables\n\nlow_dems <- data %>% \n  filter(party == \"D\" & general_percent < 0.51 & lcv_score>90) %>% \n  select(\"district_id\", \"candidate_name\", \"general_percent\", \"lcv_score\", \n         \"happeningOppose\", \n         \"humanOppose\", \n         \"congressOppose\")\n\nlow_dems$general_percent <- round(low_dems$general_percent, digit = 2)\n\n\n# Creating a table\nlow_dems %>% \n  kable(col.names = c(\"District ID\", \"Candidate Name\", \"Proportion of Votes Won\", \"LCV Score\", \n                      \"GW Happening Oppose\", \"GW Human-caused Oppose\", \"Congress Oppose\"),\n        caption = \"Table 1.

Opinions on global warming (GW) within congressional districts with Democratic representatives who won their seat in the previous election by less than 51%. Points which are further right and towards the top of the plot indicate districts that both believed global warming is largely not caused by human influence and that congress should not act strongly on global warming.\nBased on the results of the table and figure, NY-22 appears to be a district that has an audience that likely would be opposed to the Green New Deal, and thus may be easily swayed towards opposing a candidate who supports the Green New Deal. Thus, we move forward with NY-22 and target their congressperson, Anthony Brindisi, who has a high LCV score and may support the Green New Deal.\nAnalyzing New York’s 22nd Congressional District\nNew York’s 22nd Congressional District has an estimated total population of 688,391. Demographically, 89% of the total population is white. The median age is 41 years, with 80% of the population being over 18 years old. The district has 129,863 active Democratic voters and 158,376 active Republican voters. The district voted for the Republican candidate in the previous two presidential elections after having voted Democratic from 2000-2008. In the 2018 election, Anthony Brindisi won by 50.9% (127,715 votes) to Claudia Tenney (R)’s 49.1% (123,242 votes). The race was considered a battleground race and key to determining the U.S. House partisan control.\nAlong with the constituents’ opposition to Congress addressing climate change and the lack of belief of human-caused global warming, a portion of the population also believes that global warming is not happening at all (14.2%). These factors, combined with a Republican majority of enrolled voters throughout the district, makes NY-22 a prime location for a targeted campaign to replace a conservationist Democrat with a congressperson who avidly opposes the Green New Deal.\nWe identified democrat Anthony J. Brindisi who is conservation-minded and more liberal when it comes to climate policy (LCV = 97), as a potential target. Congressman Brindisi is at risk of losing reelection in New York District 22 due to a slim margin of victory in 2018 and his district constituents’ opposition to the idea of human-induced climate change (humanOppose = 37.7%) and their beliefs that Congress should not be pushing forward policies that address climate change (congressOppose = 20.3%).\nCreating a public campaign\nBecause NY-22 has an older population, we selected a newspaper advertisement as a potential route for a public campaign. A mockup of the advertisement is included below, attacking Congressman Brindisi with the hope of unseating him in the district.\n\n\n\n\n",

Introduction\nThis report explores the differences in snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) measurements in Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest, observed in Fairbanks, Alaska (Kielland et al. 2017). Snowshoe hares are prey species with fluctuating populations and are found in boreal forests. In this report, we look at weight (g) and hind foot length (mm) and differences across sex and site of juvenile snowshoe hares. Along with creating exploratory graphs, we perform a two-sample t-test and simple linear regression for comparing the variables.\n2. Data and analyses\nSnowshoe hare physical data were collected and made available by Knut Kielland and four co-creators at the Bonanza Creek Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in Fairbanks, Alaska. The data contain observations for 3197 snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), collected over 13 years (1999-2012). Following exploratory data visualization, weight between male and female juvenile hares are compared with two-sample t-tests. Differences between groups are described by Cohen’s d effect size. The relationship between hind foot length and weight is explored by simple linear regression. All analyses are in R version 4.0.2 using RStudio version 1.3.1073.\nKielland, K., F.S. Chapin, R.W. Ruess, and Bonanza Creek LTER. 2017. Snowshoe hare physical data in Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest: 1999-Present ver 22. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/03dce4856d79b91557d8e6ce2cbcdc14\n3. Preliminary results\n\n\n# First, I read in the snowshoe hares dataset before I can begin data wrangling.\n\nbonanza_hares <- read.csv(here(\"data\",\"bonanza_hares.csv\"))\n\n\n\nAnnual juvenile hare trap counts\nFirst, we count the total number of juvenile snowshoe hare trappings during each year of the study. Further variables, like sex and site, are not considered here. We are getting an overall look at the total counts of juvenile hares.\n\n\n# I begin by wrangling the data. First, I add a changed the dates to be recogniezd in mdy date format, and then I added a column to include the year.\n\nbonanza_hares_dates <- bonanza_hares %>% \n  mutate(date_updated = mdy(date)) %>% \n  mutate(year = year(date_updated))\n\n# Next, I use the count and filter functions to create a subset of the data that has counts for only the juvenile hares.\n\nage_count <- bonanza_hares_dates %>% \n  count(age, year) %>% \n  filter(age == \"j\")\n\n#  Lastly, I created a bar graph to plot the number of juvenile hares per year.\n\nggplot(data = age_count, aes(x = year, y = n)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(x = \"Time (years)\",\n       y = \"Number of juvenile hare trappings\",\n       title = \"Total number of juvenile hare trappings by year (Bonanza Creek, 1999-2012)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(20,40,60,80,100,120,140)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2011)) +\n  theme_minimal() \n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Counts of snowshoe hare trappings for juvenile hares (Lepus americanus), measured by times (years) from 1999-2012. Data: Kielland et al. (2017).\nThe number of juvenile hare trapping seems to have, generally, decreased over time from 1999 to 2012; however, we do see peaks in a few years: 2005, 2008, 2011. The mean count is 31.5, and the median count is 18.5. The minimum count of juvenile hare trappings is 2 (in 2010), and the maximum count is 126 (in 1999). The data shows that not every year had counts– 2002 and 2010 are noticeably missing. Going forward, we need to consider how many days per year the study was actually conducted; standardizing this number would help to standardize the juvenile hare population count.\nVisualizing juvenile hare weights by sex and site\n\n\n# First, I created a subset of the data to only include juvenile hares.\n\njuv_sex_hares <- bonanza_hares %>% \n  filter(age == \"j\")\n\n# Next, I used ggplot to create a beeswarm plot comparing sex and weight of the hares. I added a boxplot on top of the beeswarm to get the summary statistics. The resulting plot is faceted by site. \n\ngrid.labs <- c(\"Black Spruce\", \"Mature\", \"Riparian\")\nnames(grid.labs)<- c(\"bonbs\", \"bonmat\", \"bonrip\")\n\nggplot(data = juv_sex_hares, aes(x = sex, y = weight)) +\n  geom_beeswarm(aes(color = sex), alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"goldenrod2\",\"cyan4\"), na.value= \"coral\") +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = NA, width = 0.2, outlier.color = NA) +\n  stat_summary(fun=mean, \n               geom=\"point\", \n               shape=20, \n               size=4, \n               color=\"black\", \n               fill=\"black\") +\n  facet_wrap(~grid, labeller = labeller(grid=grid.labs)) +\n  labs(x = \"Sex\",\n       y = \"Weight (g)\",\n       title = \"Weight of juvenile hares by sex and site (Bonanza Creek, 1999-2012)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Weight (g) observations for juvenile hares of female. male, and unconfirmed sex by sampling site (Bonanza Black Spruce, Bonanza Mature, Bonanza Riparian). Gold (female), teal (male), and coral (unconfirmed sex) points indicate the weight observations at the three sites. The 25th and 75th percentile values are represented by the endpoints of the boxes, and the line and point within the boxes indicate the mean and median for each sex at each site. Data: Kielland et al. (2017).\nAt each site, the mean weight for male snowshoe hares is higher than that of females and especially larger than those of unconfirmed sex. Similarly, the median weight is higher for males consistently at each site. Comparing the sites, the Bonanza Bruce Spruce hares have a larger mean and median weight than hares in the Bonanza Mature and Bonanza Riparian sites. The data spread is wider in the Bonanza Mature and Bonanza Riparian sites than in the Bonanza Bruce site.\nComparing juvenile snowshoe hare weight by sex\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, and sample size) for juvenile snowshoe hares, grouped by sex. Data: Kielland et al. (2017).\n\n\n# I create a summary table to show the summary statistics, grouped by sex. \n\njuv_stats <- juv_sex_hares %>% \n  group_by(sex) %>% \n  summarise(mean = round(mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),2),\n            sd = round(sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE),2),\n            sample_size = n()\n            )\n\n#I use the kable package to clean the table up. \n\njuv_stats %>% \n   kable(col.names = c(\"Sex\", \"Mean (g)\", \"Standard deviation (g)\", \"Sample size\")) %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = \"striped\", full_width = FALSE)\n\n\n\nSex\n\n\nMean (g)\n\n\nStandard deviation (g)\n\n\nSample size\n\n\nf\n\n\n855.39\n\n\n292.25\n\n\n200\n\n\nm\n\n\n945.86\n\n\n333.22\n\n\n163\n\n\nNA\n\n\n614.55\n\n\n357.59\n\n\n15\n\n\nWeight (in grams) was compared for snowshoe hares of female, male, and unconfirmed sex, with other variables (such as site) not considered here.

The absolute difference in means is 90.47 mm, the difference in means is significant (Welch’s two sample t-test: t(325.02) = 2.7096, p-value = 0.007093), and the effect size is small (0.2904674).\nExploring the relationship between hind foot length and weight for juvenile hares\nTo begin, the relationship between juvenile snowshoe hare hind foot length and weight was explored across sex and site.\n\n\n# I use ggplot here to create a simple scatterplot to look at the relationship between the hind foot length and weight.\n\nggplot(data = juv_sex_hares, aes(x = hindft, y = weight)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Hind foot length (mm)\", \n       y = \"Weight (g)\",\n       title = \"Relationship between hind foot length and weight in\\njuvenile snowshoe hares (Bonanza Creek, 1999-2012)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

Data: Kielland et al. (2017).\nThe relationship was further explored by performing simple linear regression.\n\n\n# Next, I create a scatterplot and add the equation and the regression line. \n\nggplot(data = juv_sex_hares, aes(x = hindft, y = weight)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\",\n              color = \"red\",\n              size = 0.5,\n              fill = \"gray10\",\n              alpha = 0.5) + # geom_smooth is to add a linear model to a scatterplot\n  labs(x = \"Hind foot length(mm)\", y = \"Weight (g)\", title = \"Relationship between hind foot length and weight in\\njuvenile snowshoe hares (Bonanza Creek, 1999-2012)\") +\n  theme_light() +\n    ggpubr::stat_regline_equation(label.x = 60, label.y = 1600)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Relationship between hind foot length (mm) and weight (g) for juvenile snowshoe hares. The individual points represent individual juvenile snowshoe hares measurements. Linear model summary: \\(\\beta\\) = 0.0314 g mm-1, p-value < 0.001, R2 = 0.2925, Pearson’s r = 0.547. Data: Kielland et al. (2017).\nSimple linear regression revealed that hind foot length significantly predicts weight of juvenile snowshoe hares (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.2925), so that 30% of variance in hind foot length is explained by weight. The average slope is \\(\\beta\\) = 0.0314g mm-1, meaning that for every 1 mm increase in hind foot length, we expect the weight to increase by 0.0314 g. Hind foot length and weight are moderately positively correlated, with a Pearson’s r of 0.547. Because the correlation is not strong, in the future we may want to investigate the influence other variables, like sex and site, have on hind foot length and weight’s relationship.\nSummary\nExploratory data analysis of the snowshoe hare data revealed the following findings:\nMale juvenile snowshoe hares have a higher mean weight than females and hares of unconfirmed sex (the difference is significant, but effect size is small)\nThe Bonanza Bruce Spruce site has hares with a higher over mean and median weight across sexes\nHind foot length significantly predicts weight of juvenile snowshoe hares\nHind foot length and weight are moderately correlated\nNext steps:\nStandardize juvenile hare population by considering days per year that the study is conducted\nConduct linear regression to investigate influence of sex and site on the relationship between hind foot length and weight\nCitations\nKielland, K., F.S.
